# LINKEDIN_JOB_SEARCH_BOT

## Overview
The **LinkedIn Job Search Bot** is a Python-based web scraping tool that automates the process of searching and extracting job postings from LinkedIn. Users can input job designations, locations, and the number of pages to scrape, and the bot will navigate LinkedIn’s job section, extract detailed job information, and save the data as structured JSON files for further analysis.

## Features
- **Automated LinkedIn Login:** The bot handles LinkedIn login securely using user-provided credentials.
- **Job Search Automation:** Scrapes job postings based on user-specified designation, location, and number of pages.
- **Detailed Job Data Extraction:** Retrieves job title, company name, location, posting date, work type, and job listing URL.
- **Output as JSON Files:** Saves each job's details in a JSON file, organized in a dedicated output directory.
- **Error Handling:** Handles common web scraping issues like timeouts, missing elements, and pagination errors.
- **Scalability:** Can be customized to scrape more job details or adapted for other websites.

## Input
1. **LinkedIn Credentials:**
   - Email ID
   - Password
2. **Search Parameters:**
   - Job Designation
   - Job Location
   - Number of Pages to Scrape

## Output
- **JSON Files:** Each job's details are stored in individual JSON files with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
      "Job Title": "Software Engineer",
      "Company": "TechCorp",
      "Portal Link": "https://www.linkedin.com/",
      "Job Listing Link": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/12345678",
      "Location": "Hyderabad, India",
      "Date of Posting": "Posted 2 days ago",
      "Work Type": "Full-time"
  }
  ```
- **Output Directory:** JSON files are saved in a directory named using the format: `<designation>_<location>_<timestamp>`.

## How It Works
1. **LinkedIn Login:** The bot launches a Chrome browser, navigates to LinkedIn, and logs in using the provided credentials.
2. **Job Search:** Constructs a URL for job search using the input designation and location and scrapes job postings across multiple pages.
3. **Data Extraction:** Extracts job details using Selenium for navigation and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
4. **JSON Storage:** Saves the extracted details as JSON files for each job.
5. **Error Management:** Includes mechanisms to handle common issues like missing elements and pagination errors.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Automation:** Selenium
- **HTML Parsing:** BeautifulSoup
- **Data Handling:** Pandas
- **File Management:** OS, JSON

## Future Enhancements
1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze JSON files to match job postings with user resumes.
   - Use natural language processing (NLP) to find the best-suited jobs based on skills and experience.
2. **Visualization:**
   - Generate dashboards or visual reports for job trends, salary ranges, and locations.
3. **Integration with Resume Parsing:**
   - Parse user resumes to fetch key skills and compare them with job requirements.
4. **Job Alerts:**
   - Implement email or SMS notifications for newly posted jobs matching specific criteria.
5. **Multi-Platform Support:**
   - Extend scraping capabilities to other job portals like Indeed, Naukri, and Monster.

## Additional Technologies Required for Future Work
